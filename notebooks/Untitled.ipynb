We can instead use a `for` loop\\n# \\n# A `for` loop starts with the *keyword* for, followed by the name of the variable that will be changed with every loop, then `in` and the name of the variable that you want to loop through (*iterator variable*) and a colon `:`. Code is then written in an indented block (4 spaces or a tab in front of each line in the block)\\n\\n# In[5]:\\n\\n\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    print(age, my_ages)\\n\\n\\n# In[77]:\\n\\n\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    print(age+1) # perform a calculation\\n\\n\\n# ### Notes about iterator variables\\n# \\n# The *iterator variable* can be named whatever you like, but it is best to name them sensibly.\\n\\n# In[78]:\\n\\n\\nfor bananas in my_ages:\\n    print(bananas)#bananas??\\n\\n\\n# It should be noted that using the same name for the iterator variable as an existing variable will overwrite it.\\n\\n# In[79]:\\n\\n\\n# Define age\\nage = 42\\nprint(age)\\n\\n\\n# In[80]:\\n\\n\\n# Also use age as an iterator variable\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    print(age)\\n\\n\\n# In[81]:\\n\\n\\n# Age has been replaced by the last value of age in the loop\\nprint(age)\\n\\n\\n# The fact that the iterator variable is accessible outside the loop can be useful for bugfixing\\n\\n# In[82]:\\n\\n\\n# This will throw an error when it tries to add 1 to banana\\n#for age in [1, 2, \"banana\", 4]:\\n#    print(age+1)\\n\\n\\n# After an error we could print the value of our iterator variable (age) to see what the value was when the code crashed\\n\\n# In[83]:\\n\\n\\n#print(age)\\n\\n\\n# ### Indentations are important\\n# \\n# Indentations are very important. Only indented lines are considered part of the loop. \\n\\n# In[84]:\\n\\n\\n# All lines indented.\\nmy_ages = [1, 2, 3, 4]\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    print(age)\\n    print(age+2)\\n    print(\"Finished printing age \",age)\\n\\n\\n# In[85]:\\n\\n\\n# the final age+2 is not contained within the loop, so is executed afterwards.\\nmy_ages = [1, 2, 3, 4]\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    print(age)\\n    print(\"Finished printing age \",age)\\nprint(\"loop over\")\\nprint(age+2) # Not in the loop, just whatever the final value of age was,+2\\n\\n\\n\\n# ### Getting values out of a loop\\n# \\n# Printing values in a loop is nice, and a good thing to do to see how your code is running. However it is likely you want to save the results of calculations inside the loop.\\n\\n# In[86]:\\n\\n\\nmy_ages = [54, 34, 23, 45] #what we will loop through\\nmy_ages_next_year = [] #empty list to store results in\\n\\nprint(\"Start length: \",len(my_ages_next_year))#print the starting length of our results list\\nfor age in my_ages:\\n    new_age = age + 1 #calculate and store result in variable\\n    print(new_age) #print calculation result\\n    my_ages_next_year.append(new_age) #add result of calculation to results list\\n    print(\"New length: \",len(my_ages_next_year))#print the starting length of our results list\\n\\nprint(my_ages_next_year) #print results\\n\\n\\n\\n# In[87]:\\n\\n\\n# List of words\\nwords = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\\n\\n# Using loops, \\n# calculate the length of each word\\n# If you feel confident,\\n# Store the lengths in a list\\nword_lengths = []\\nfor word in words:\\n    word_len = len(word)\\n    print(word_len)\\n    word_lengths.append(word_len)\\n    \\nprint (word_lengths)\\n\\n\\n# ### Ranges to generate number sequences\\n# If we want to generate a sequence of numbers, we can use the range function\\n\\n# In[88]:\\n\\n\\nfor number in range(10):\\n    print(number)\\n\\n\\n# Range starts from 0 by default, and the second value is not inclusive. So if we want 1 to 10:\\n\\n# In[89]:\\n\\n\\nfor number in range(1,11):\\n    print(number)\\n\\n\\n# In[90]:\\n\\n\\nmy_range = range(1, 11)\\n\\n\\n# In[91]:\\n\\n\\nprint(my_range) # Not a list\\n\\nfor number in my_range:\\n    print(number)\\n\\n\\n# ### Accumulator pattern\\n# A different way of storing the results of a loop in a single value\\n\\n# In[92]:\\n\\n\\nmy_word = \"Lithium\"\\n#Loop through and print \\n# every letter in this word\\n# Calculate word length without using len\\n\\n# Create a variable to count the length of the word\\nlength_word = 0\\n\\nfor letter in my_word:\\n    print(letter)\\n    # Calculate length_word + 1\\n    new_value = length_word + 1\\n    # Replace length_word with the new value (length_word + 1)\\n    length_word = new_value\\n    # length_word will increase in size by 1 every loop.\\n\\nprint (\"length of word is\",length_word)\\n\\n\\n\\n# In[ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
